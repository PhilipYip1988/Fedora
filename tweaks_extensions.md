## Tweaks and Extensions

### GNOME Tweaks

Vanilla GNOME does not have a minimise and maximise button. These can be added using GNOME Tweaks:

GNOME Tweaks contains additional settings to GNOME settings, that aren't yet incorporated into GNOME Settings. Essentially there is similar situation between these two applications as the Legacy Control Panel and Windows Settings found in Windows.

GNOME Tweaks is not preinstalled and should be installed from software:

Select Install:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_003.png" alt="img_003" width="600"/>

Select Open:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_004.png" alt="img_004" width="600"/>

Select the Windows tab and change the Maximise and Minimise Titlebar buttons to On:

Notice these now show in the open Windows.

### GNOME Extensions

GNOME Extensions were originally part of GNOME Tweaks but is now a separate application. It is not preinstalled and needs to be installed using software. There are two versions Extensions (Only shows Extensions maintained GNOME Development Team) and Extension Manager (Allows searching and installation of Extensions by Third-Party Developers). The official Extensions application will be installed first:
