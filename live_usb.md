The Fedora Live environment essentially uses the Bootable USB as a storage drive and details about the background services being run in RAM will display:

The Live GNOME Desktop Environment has a Dock and the installer is open by default:

If the installer is selected, notice that it takes focus and the Dock disappears. Press `⊞` to view the GNOME Dock. This will take the application out of focus. All applications will be re-tiled so the open application of interest can be selected. The dock has the all applications button `𓃑`.

Select the installer and select install Fedora:

Select your language and regional variation and select Continue:

This will determine your Localisation and Time and Date Settings which can be further modified if desired on the next screen.

Select Installation Destination:

Notice that the internal NVMe SSD is selected, indicated by the black tick:

Note that selecting this again, unchecks the drive:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_010.png" alt="img_010" width="800"/>

Selecting it again rechecks this drive and the black tick displays. Select Done:

Select Begin Installation:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_012.png" alt="img_012" width="800"/>

The installation will proceed. Select Finish Installation:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_013.png" alt="img_013" width="800"/>

Note that the Live GNOME Desktop Environment is running and this is not the installed Desktop Environment. To exit it, go to the Power Menu and select Power Options:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_014.png" alt="img_014" width="800"/>

Select Restart:

Select Restart:

The system should now restart, taking you to the Fedora Out of the Box Experience. [Return to Fedora Installation](./readme.md)
