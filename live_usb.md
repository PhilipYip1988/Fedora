Select test this media & Start Fedora Live:

The Fedora Live environment essentially uses the Bootable USB as a storage drive and details about the background services being run in RAM will display:

The Live GNOME Desktop Environment has a Dock and the installer is open by default:

If the installer is selected, notice that it takes focus and the Dock disappears. Press `âŠž` to view the GNOME Dock. This will take the application out of focus. All applications will be re-tiled so the open application of interest can be selected. The dock has the all applications button which is similar to the Windows start screen.

Select the installer and select install Fedora:

Select your language and regional variation and select Continue:

This will determine your Localisation and Time and Date Settings which can be further modified if desired on the next screen.

Select Installation Destination:

Notice that the internal NVMe SSD is selected, indicated by the black tick:

Note that selecting this again, unchecks the drive:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_010.png" alt="img_010" width="800"/>

Selecting it again rechecks this drive and the black tick displays. Select Done:

Select Begin Installation:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_012.png" alt="img_012" width="800"/>

The installation will proceed. Select Finish Installation:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_013.png" alt="img_013" width="800"/>

Note that the Live GNOME Desktop Environment is running and this is not the installed Desktop Environment. To exit it, go to the Power Menu and select Power Options:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_014.png" alt="img_014" width="800"/>

Select Restart:

<img src="./images/live_usb/img_015.png" alt="img_015" width="800"/>

Select Restart:

The system should now restart, taking you to the Fedora Out of the Box Experience. [Return to Fedora Installation](./readme.md)
