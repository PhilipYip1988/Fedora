# System Requirements

This guide covers installation of Fedora on a system that is subject to the following minimum system requirements:

* Manufactured Date: Late 2015
* BIOS: UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot
* Processor: Intel 6th Generation (i3, i5 or i7) Processor or AMD Ryzen Processor
* 8 GB RAM
* 250 GB NVMe SSD or SATA SSD
* Touchscreen Convertible (Optional)

Satisfying the minimum system requirements mentioned above will give a good Fedora experience with the current Wayland display protocol. It is possible to run Fedora on lesser hardware using the legacy XOrg Display Protocol and Legacy BIOS although there was a recent discussion onÂ [Depreciating Legacy BIOS Support](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DeprecateLegacyBIOS).
