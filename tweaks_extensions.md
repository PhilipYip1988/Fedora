## Tweaks and Extensions

The vanilla GNOME Shell can be modified using tweaks and extensions. Third-party extensions vary in development quality and some may lead to instabilities. The ones mentioned in this guide all have active developers and a large userbase and therefore generally work as expected.

### GNOME Tweaks

Vanilla GNOME does not have a minimise and maximise button. These can be added using GNOME Tweaks:

GNOME Tweaks contains additional settings to GNOME settings, that aren't yet incorporated into GNOME Settings. Essentially there is similar situation between these two applications as the Legacy Control Panel and Windows Settings found in Windows.

GNOME Tweaks is not preinstalled and should be installed from software:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_002.png" alt="img_002" width="600"/>

Select Install:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_003.png" alt="img_003" width="600"/>

Select Open:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_004.png" alt="img_004" width="600"/>

Select the Windows tab and change the Maximise and Minimise Titlebar buttons to On:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_005.png" alt="img_005" width="600"/>

Notice these now show in the open Windows.

### GNOME Extensions

GNOME Extensions were originally part of GNOME Tweaks but is now a separate application. It is not preinstalled and needs to be installed using software. There are two versions Extensions (Only shows Extensions maintained GNOME Development Team) and Extension Manager (Allows searching and installation of Extensions by Third-Party Developers). The official Extensions application will be installed first:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_006.png" alt="img_006" width="600"/>

Select Install:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_007.png" alt="img_007" width="600"/>

Select Open:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_008.png" alt="img_008" width="600"/>

Ensure Extensions are enabled:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_009.png" alt="img_009" width="600"/>

The App Menu can be used to access applications from the titlebar:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_010.png" alt="img_010" width="600"/>

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_011.png" alt="img_011" width="600"/>

Places can be used to access folders from the titlebar: 

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_012.png" alt="img_012" width="600"/>

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_013.png" alt="img_013" width="600"/>

Window list can be enabled to show all the open Windows at the bottom of the screen:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_014.png" alt="img_014" width="600"/>

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_015.png" alt="img_015" width="600"/>

### Extension Manager

The Extension Manager can be installed in software. Select install: 

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_016.png" alt="img_016" width="600"/>

Select Open:

<img src="./images/tweaks_extensions/img_017.png" alt="img_017" width="600"/>

The Extension Manager looks similar to Extensions however lists User Installed Extensions:

And has a Browse button which can be used to search for other extensions.

#### Dash to Dock Extension

The Dash to Dock Extension is installed by Canonical in Ubuntu to give modified GNOME Desktop Environment. It can be installed in Fedora to make similar modifications or to alternatively make GNOME behave more like the Windows Desktop Environment. Select Install:

To make modifications similar to Ubuntu in the Position and Size tab select left, disable Intelligent Autohide and disable Panel mode:
