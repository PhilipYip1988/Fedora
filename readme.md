# Fedora

In this guide, I look at installation and setup of Fedora on a Dell Latitude (9420) 14 2 in 1 Touchscreen Convertible Device with a WD19TB Thunderbolt Dock. Fedora is the leading edge Linux Distribution and includes Linux Kernel 6.8, the GNOME 46 Desktop Environment and the Wayland Display Protocol. If third-party repositories are enabled, FlatPak packages are installable from Software. Software can seamlessly be used to install new Applications, handles Operating System Updates, Application Updates and Device Firmware Updates via the Linux Vendor Service. This integrated functionality makes Fedora much more logical than most other Linux distributions that typically fragment these components.

Fedora uses a vanilla GNOME however this can be customised using GNOME Tweaks, GNOME Extensions and GNOME Settings as shown in this guide. The GNOME Desktop Environment is the Linux Desktop environment that has the most support for a 2 in 1 Touchscreen Convertible Device exhibiting a Touchscreen Keyboard and Device autorotation out of the box.

## System Requirements

For a good Fedora Experience, the PC should match the following system requirements:

* [System Requirements](./requirements.md)

## Creating Installation Media

The Bootable USB can be created on Windows, Linux and Mac using the Fedora Media Writer:

* [Creating a Bootable USB Using the Fedora Media Writer Windows](./fedora_media_writer_windows.md)

## Updating the BIOS from USB

BIOS Updates are often released in order to accomodate new Operating Systems. It is recommended to make sure your BIOS is up to date before installing Fedora.

* [Updating the BIOS from USB Windows](./bios_update_usb.md)

## BIOS Setup

Some of the BIOS Settings need to be changed in order for Linux to recognise the Storage Device:

* [BIOS Setup and Data Wipe](./bios_setup.md)

## Live USB Installation

The Fedora Live USB can be used to boot into a GNOME Live Desktop Environment where the Services are run using RAM and the USB is used as a storage drive. The Live USB can be used to install Fedora:

* [Installation from Live USB](./live_usb.md)

## Out of the Box Setup

The Out of the Box Setup prompts to connect to a Wireless Network, Enable Third-Party Flatpak Repositories, Manage Privacy Settings and perform a Software Update:
